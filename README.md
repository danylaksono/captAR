# captAR
## Augmented Reality Location-based Capture the Flag

Real-time mobile game built with React-Native, React-Native-Maps, Geolib, Redux, Firebase for iOS and Android

### How To Play

Coming soon to the App Store & Google Play. 

> Note: Until then, users may clone this repository, run 'npm install', 'react-native link', and 'node seed', and build to either an [iOS phone via XCode](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html) or [Android phone via Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#connect) to play captAR.

Game setup:
* Gather friends at a nearby park. We suggest 2-8 players, even numbers, and Battery Park, Bowling Green or Elevated Acre.
* Login with Google or Facebook. The first to sign in should create a game. The rest should join their game.
* Select your park and position yourselves on your team's side of the game field.

To Win:
* Advance towards your team's flag on the opposite team's territory.
* Get in the flag's geofence and hit the 'Capture' button to render captAR's AR split screen camera mode. Press on the camera view flag to capture it! 
* Return to your team's side with the flag. You should see the flag move with you on map view. But careful--the opposite team can intercept the flag when near you, automatically returning the flag back to its place.
